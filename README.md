# RemindMe - Python Challenge

Welcome to Gazwah-Ent take home challenge!

In this repository you will find API specification & scaffolding code for the web app named `RemindMe`.

`RemindMe` is a simple web app that allows users to create reminder for their schedules.

You can check the API specification for this web app in [`rest_api.md`](./docs/rest_api.md).

## Your Mission

1. Build the web app based on specification written in `README.md` and [`rest_api.md`](./docs/rest_api.md). **Treat it as an MVP**. For the backend you must use Python with any framework. For the frontend you can use any framework you like or even just vanilla HTML, CSS, & Javascript, but make sure it completely uses the REST API.
2. Write automated testing for your backend. At the very minimum you must implement unit testing (not feature testing). If you can write automated testing for your frontend as well, that would be great.

## Evaluation

We will evaluate your submission based on these criteria:

1. The quality of your web app experience from end-user perspective.
2. The correctness of your implementation according to the specification docs.
3. Your choice of tradeoffs during development based on both business & technical perspective.
4. Readability, maintainability, & testability of your code.
5. The quality of your workflow when using Github. This includes the quality of your commit messages, pull requests, & branch naming.

## Submission

1. Fork this repository & do your work in your own forked repository.
2. Submit your CV in PDF along with the URL of your forked repository to mail: **fajar.riswandi05@gmail.com** with subject: **Gazwah Coding Challenge**.
3. We will review your submission & get back to you as soon as possible.
